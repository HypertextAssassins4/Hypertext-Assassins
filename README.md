This is a web-based password protected diary. 

The project description is to add in a button that will show information in the webpage, which will be coming from the server. 
For any of the information to be shown the user must input the correct password when prompted. When the user puts the correct 
password in, the information will be shown as a ‘display area’. For every new diary input, there must be a way to input the 
information that is saved to the server, so that the next time the diary is opened the information will be shown. There must 
also be a button that will lock the diary which will remove the diary information from the webpage.

The function requirements used to accomplish this are:
- There should be two input boxes: the first one is for username and the second one is for password. 
- Under the two input boxes there will be a “next” button and a “sign up” button. 
- After tapping the “sign up” button, there should be three input boxes for “username”, “password” and “confirm password”. 
- Under the three input boxes there will be “back” and “submit” buttons in the left and right sides. 
- The password will must be a minimum 8 characters long. 
- The font for the diary entries must be the same font style throughout.
- The background colour of each page (Display Area) of this diary should look as though it is mimicking pages inside a physical diary
- The diary entries should all be in the same dimensions, all in line going down the page
- Each diary entry should be dated before they are started, and the entries should be order by their dates
- The button for locking the diary should be in the lower left corner, that should be a photo of a lock.
  When clicked, the password prompt should show up. After the password is entered, the image should change to a photo of an open lock.
- There should be a button “previous” on the top left to go to the previous entry, a button “next” on the top right to go to the next entry. 
  Finally, there should be a button in the middle of those two called “directory” that will take you to a main page where the rest of the diary entries are located. 
- In every diary page, there should be a “save” button next to the “previous” button to save the information. 
- In each page, there should be a button “close the diary / lock the diary” to log out and remove the diary information from the page. 
- The diary will be saved automatically when logging out.
