This is a web-based password protected diary, created using html, css, javascript and jquery. 

The project description is to add in a button that will show information in the webpage, which will be coming from the server. 
For any of the information to be shown the user must input the correct password when prompted. When the user puts the correct 
password in, the information will be shown as a ‘display area’. For every new diary input, there must be a way to input the 
information that is saved to the server, so that the next time the diary is opened the information will be shown. There must 
also be a button that will lock the diary which will remove the diary information from the webpage.

The function requirements used to accomplish this are:
- There should be two input boxes: the first one is for username and the second one is for password. 
- Under the two input boxes there will be a “next” button and a “sign up” button. 
- After tapping the “sign up” button, there should be three input boxes for “username”, “password” and “confirm password”. 
- Under the three input boxes there will be “back” and “submit” buttons in the left and right sides. 
- The password will must be a minimum 8 characters long. 
- The font for the diary entries must be the same font style throughout.
- The background colour of each page (Display Area) of this diary should look as though it is mimicking pages inside a physical diary
- The diary entries should all be in the same dimensions, all in line going down the page
- Each diary is dated automatically when each diary is updated or created. 
- There is a catalogue list on the side of the page, if you want to go to another entry you can always click any entry(previous or next) from the catalogue list at all times. 
- The diary is saved automatically when you enter any information in the entry space at all times. 
- there is an entry title for every entry.
- A sign out button is there when you want to sign out of the diary which directs you back to the main page.
